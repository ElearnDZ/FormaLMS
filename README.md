# FormaLMS
GitHub fork of FormaLMS, based on upgrades to Docebo 1.4

FormaLMS is an Open Source Learning Management System (LMS) based on the last Open Source release of Docebo. It contains several upgrades from Docebo, including over 70 bug fixes and enhancements.

FormaLMS supports a very modular design, ranging from course and content management to language and user and organizational hierarchy configurations.

FormaLMS support SCORM 1.4 and SCORM 2004 contents, for interoperability with tools such as iSpring or Adobe Captivate for producing and publishing courses.

It should be possible to install FormaLMS easily enough on Linux and Mac OS X instances.
